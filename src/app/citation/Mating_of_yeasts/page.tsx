            <p>
                The yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is a simple <Link slug="Microorganism" title="single-celled" /> <Link slug="Eukaryote" title="eukaryote" /> with both a diploid and haploid mode of existence. The <Bold>mating of yeast</Bold> only occurs between haploids, which can be either the <Bold>a</Bold> or Î± (alpha) mating type and thus display simple sexual differentiation. Mating type is determined by a single locus, <i>MAT</i>, which in turn governs the sexual behaviour of both haploid and diploid cells. Through a form of genetic recombination, haploid yeast can switch mating type as often as every cell cycle.
