                <Bold><i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i></Bold>, commonly known as <Bold>zombie-ant fungus</Bold>, is an insect-pathogenic fungus, discovered by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859, and currently found predominantly in tropical forest ecosystems. <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i> infects ants of the tribe <i>Camponotini</i>, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their mandibles to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death. The process, leading up to mortality, takes 4â€“10 days, and includes a reproductive stage where fruiting bodies grow from the ant&apos;s head, rupturing to release the fungus&apos;s spores. <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i> is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.

                <br />
                Ophiocordyceps unilateralis and related <Link slug="Species" title="species" /> are known to engage in an active secondary metabolism for, among other reasons, the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by natural products chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the polyketide family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.

                After years of research, the taxonomy of <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i> is becoming increasingly clear.

            <p>
                <br />
                Throughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between the genera <Bold>Cordyceps</Bold> and <i><Bold>Ohpiocordyceps</Bold></i>. There have been many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as <i>Ophiocordyceps</i> was only recently brought forward.
                <br />
                <br />
                The <Link slug="Genus" title="genus" /> <i>Cordyceps</i> comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the family Clavicipitaceae within the order Hypocreales. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform ascospores and cylindrical asci. When <i>Cordyceps</i> were first classified, there was no concrete evidence for the genus <i>Ophiocordyceps</i>. However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to reorganize the family Clavicipitaceae. It was found that Clavicipitaceae was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the <i>Clavicipitaceae</i>, the <i>Cordycipitaceae</i> and the <i>Ophiocordycipitaceae</i>.
                <br />
                <br />
                The new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all <i>Cordyceps</i> species forming a sister group with <i>Tolypocladium</i>, into <Bold>Ophiocordycipitaceae</Bold>. Fungi able to parasitize ants were also included in the transfer, such as <i>Cordyceps unilateralis</i> which was later renamed <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i>. Following this study, multiple traits such as the production of darkly pigmented, hard to flexible stromata were defined as characteristics of the family Ophiocordycipitaceae.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

            <h1 className="text-xl font-bold"><i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralissensu lato</i></h1>
            <p>
                <br />
                The fungus&apos;s scientific name is sometimes written as <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato</i>, which means &apos;in the <Bold>broad sense</Bold>&apos;, because the species actually represents a complex of many species within <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i>.
                <br />
                <br />
                Support for this term has become increasingly important. In 2011, it was hypothesized that the zombie-ant fungus could actually be described as a complex of species which are host-specific, meaning that one <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i> species can only successfully infect and manipulate one host ant species. There is a possibility that this resulted in or reinforced the reproductive isolation of the <Link slug="Fungi" title="fungi" />, leading to its speciation. Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited, using morphological comparisons of the ascospores, germination processes, and asexual morphs, four different <i>Ophiocordyceps</i> species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the <Bold>Brazilian Amazon</Bold>, six in <Bold>Thailand</Bold>, and one in <Bold>Japan</Bold>.
                <br />
                <br />
                More recently in 2018, 15 new <i>Ohiocordyceps unilateralis</i> species were described based on classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology. The asexual morphologies made it possible to distinguish two different clades mainly composed of species associated with ants which they termed &quot;<Bold><i>O. unilateralis</i> core clade</Bold>&quot; and &quot;<Bold><i>O. kniphofioides</i> subclade</Bold>.&quot;.
                <br />
                <br />
                Further analyses were conducted using a set of different traits. Morphological traits were used and included both macro-morphological characters (e.g. typical single stroma arising from the host&apos;s dorsal pronotum, the ascoma (perithecia) growing from the stroma) and microscopic traits (e.g. the morphology of the ascospores in terms of size, shape, septation and germination). Moreover, other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip were added to the analyses. The morphological study led to 15 new identified species, with 14 which were distributed in the core clade, and one in the subclade. Moreover, it was found that species in the <i>O. kniphofioides</i> subclade specialise on neotropical ants, whereas species in the core clade specialise on <i>Camponotini</i> species.

                The zombie-ant fungus is easily identifiable when its reproductive structure becomes apparent on its dead host, usually a carpenter ant. At the end of its life cycle, <i>O. unilateralis</i> typically generates a single, wiry yet pliant, darkly pigmented stroma which arises from the dorsal pronotum region of the ant once it is dead. Moreover, perithecia, the spore-bearing sexual structure, can be observed on the stalk, just below its tip. This complex forms the fungus&apos; fruiting body.
                <br />
                <br />
                Most species within the <i>O. unilateralis s.l.</i> species complex have both a sexual (teleomorph) and an asexual morph (anamorph). These are different in terms of their function and characteristics. Generally, the asexual morphs identified for Ophiocordyceps are <i>Hirsutella</i> and <i>Hymenostilbe</i>, two genera of asexually reproducing fungi.

            <p>
                <i>O. unilateralis</i> species exhibit morphological variations which are most certainly due to their wide geographic range, from Japan to the Americas. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that their morphological variations may also be a result of one fungus species maximizing its infection on one specific host ant species (host-specific infections). Different subspecies of ant can occur within the same area, which means that in order to coexist they have to occupy different ecological niches. Consequently, the fungi may have evolved at the subspecies level in order to maximize its fitness.

            <SubTitle><i>O. unilateralis</i> core clade morphological characteristics</SubTitle>
            <p>
                The <i>O. unilateralis</i> core clade, as described in 2018, has distinct morphological characteristics. It exhibits a single stroma with a <i>Hirsutella</i> asexual morph, which arises from the dorsal neck region of the dead ant and produces a dark brown perithecia attached to its stalk. These species are also recognizable through the host species they infect, which are only Camponotini species. Once the host is killed by the fungus, it is commonly found fixed through their mandibles onto the surfaces of leaves.

            <SubTitle><i>O. kniphofioides</i> subclade morphological characteristics</SubTitle>
            <p>
                The <i>O. kniphofioides</i> subclade, as described in 2018, also has distinct morphological characteristics. Its species produce a stroma that grows laterally from the host&apos;s thorax which itself generates an orange ascoma. Moreover, species within this subclade share a <i>Hirsutella</i> asexual morph. As for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The subclade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous &quot;death grip&quot; that <i>O. unilateralis</i> species typically exhibit. Their hosts usually die at the base of large trees in the Amazonian rainforest, among the moss carpets.
