                Although some scientists equate the term &quot;humans&quot; with all members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. All other members of the genus Homo, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term &quot;modern human&quot; is used to distinguish Homo sapiens from archaic humans. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> or a similar species. Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans. Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as <i>Neanderthals</i> include competition, violence, interbreeding with <i>Homo Sapiens</i>, or inability to adapt to climate change.

                For most of their history, humans were <Link slug="Nomadic" title="nomadic" /> hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting <Link slug="Behavioral_modernity" title="behavioral modernity" /> about 160,000–60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of <Link slug="Agriculture" title="agriculture" /> and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the <Link slug="Cradle_of_humanity" title="development of civilization" /> and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid <Link slug="Technological_change" title="technological change" />. Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of <Link slug="Socioculture" title="sociocultural" /> and <Link slug="History_of_technology" title="technological" /> developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle.

                <Link slug="Gene" title="Genes" /> and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), humans are among the least genetically diverse primates. Any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of <Bold>pregnancy</Bold>, usually between <Bold>puberty</Bold>, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.
                <br />
                <br />
                Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of <i>Homo erectus</i>. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.
                <br />
                <br />
                Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent and capable of episodic memory; they have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations through <Link slug="Language" title="language" />.

                All modern humans are classified into the <Link slug="Species" title="species" /> <i>Homo sapiens</i>, coined by Carl Linnaeus in his 1735 work <i>Systema Naturae</i>. The <Redirect href="/base/Genus#Generic_name" text="generic name" /> &quot;<Link slug="Homo" title="Homo" />&quot; is a learned 18th-century derivation from Latin <i>homō</i>, which refers to humans of either sex. The word <i>human</i> can refer to all members of the <i>Homo</i> genus. The name &quot;<i>Homo sapiens</i>&quot; means &apos;wise man&apos; or &apos;knowledgeable man&apos;. There is disagreement if certain extinct members of the genus, namely Neanderthals, should be included as a separate species of humans or as a subspecies of <i>H. sapiens</i>.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>Human</i> is a loanword of Middle English from Old French <i>humain</i>, ultimately from Latin <i>hūmānus</i>, the adjectival form of <i>homō</i> (&apos;man&apos; – in the sense of humanity). The native English term <i>man</i> can refer to the species generally (a synonym for idhumanity) as well as to human males. It may also refer to individuals of either sex.

                Despite the fact that the word <i>animal</i> is colloquially used as an antonym for <i>human</i>, and contrary to a common biological misconception, humans are animals. The word <i>person</i> is often used interchangeably with <i>human</i>, but philosophical debate exists as to whether personhood applies to all humans or all sentient beings, and further if one can lose personhood (such as by going into a persistent vegetative state).

                Humans are apes (superfamily Hominoidea). The lineage of apes that eventually gave rise to humans first split from gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and orangutans (genus <i>Pongo</i>), then gorillas (genus <i>Gorilla</i>), and finally, chimpanzees and bonobos (genus <i>Pan</i>). The last split, between the human and chimpanzee–bonobo lineages, took place around 8–4 million years ago, in the late Miocene epoch. During this split, chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes. Following their split with chimpanzees and bonobos, the <Bold>hominins</Bold> diversified into many species and at least two distinct genera. All but one of these lineages – representing the genus <i>Homo</i> and its sole extant species <i>Homo sapiens</i> – are now extinct.
                <br />
                <br />
                The genus <i>Homo</i> evolved from <i>Australopithecus</i>. Though fossils from the transition are scarce, the earliest members of <i>Homo</i> share several key traits with <i>Australopithecus</i>. The earliest record of <i>Homo</i> is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, and the earliest named species are <i>Homo habilis</i> and <i>Homo rudolfensis</i> which evolved by 2.3 million years ago. <i>H. erectus</i> (the African variant is sometimes called <i>H. ergaster</i>) evolved 2 million years ago and was the first archaic human species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia. <i>H. erectus</i> also was the first to evolve a characteristically human body plan. <i>Homo sapiens</i> emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago from a species commonly designated as either <i>H. heidelbergensis</i> or <i>H. rhodesiensis</i>, the descendants of <i>H. erectus</i> that remained in Africa. <i>H. sapiens</i> migrated out of the continent, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–70,000 years ago, and possibly earlier.

                The "out of Africa" migration took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second (Southern Dispersal) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago. <i>H. sapiens</i> proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Eurasia 125,000 years ago, Australia around 65,000 years ago, the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand in the years 300 to 1280 CE.

                Human evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved interbreeding between related species. Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution. <Link slug="DNA" title="DNA" /> evidence suggests that several genes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non sub-Saharan-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their <Link slug="Genome" title="genome" /> to present-day non sub-Saharan-African humans.
                <br />
                <br />
                Human evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes that have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The most significant of these adaptations are <Redirect href="/base/Prehistory_of_nakedness_and_hairlessness#Evolution_of_hairlessness" text="hairlessness" />, obligate <Link slug="Bipedality" title="bipedalism" />, increased <Link slug="Human_Brain" title="brain" /> size and decreased sexual dimorphism (neoteny). The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.

                Until about 12,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic Revolution (the invention of agriculture) first took place in Southwest Asia and spread through large parts of the Old World over the following millennia. It also occurred independently in Mesoamerica (about 6,000 years ago), China, Papua New Guinea, and the Sahel and West Savanna regions of Africa.

                An urban revolution took place in the 4th millennium BCE with the development of city-states, particularly <Link slug="Sumer" title="Sumerian" /> cities located in Mesopotamia. It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, cuneiform script, appeared around 3000 BCE. Other major civilizations to develop around this time were Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley Civilization. They eventually traded with each other and invented technology such as wheels, plows and sails. Astronomy and mathematics were also developed and the Great Pyramid of Giza was built. There is evidence of a severe drought lasting about a hundred years that may have caused the decline of these civilizations, with new ones appearing in the aftermath. Babylonians came to dominate Mesopotamia while others, such as the Poverty Point culture, Minoans and the Shang dynasty, rose to prominence in new areas. The Late Bronze Age collapse around 1200 BCE resulted in the disappearance of a number of civilizations and the beginning of the Greek Dark Ages. During this period iron started replacing bronze, leading to the Iron Age.

                In the 5th century BCE, history started being recorded as a discipline, which provided a much clearer picture of life at the time. Between the 8th and 6th century BCE, Europe entered the classical antiquity age, a period when ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished. Around this time other civilizations also came to prominence. The Maya civilization started to build cities and create complex calendars. In Africa, the Kingdom of Aksum overtook the declining Kingdom of Kush and facilitated trade between India and the Mediterranean. In West Asia, the Achaemenid Empire&apos;s system of centralized governance became the precursor to many later empires, while the Gupta Empire in India and the Han dynasty in China have been described as golden ages in their respective regions.

                Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Europe entered the Middle Ages. During this period, Christianity and the Church would provide centralized authority and education. In the Middle East, Islam became the prominent religion and expanded into North Africa. It led to an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. The Christian and Islamic worlds would eventually clash, with the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire declaring a series of holy wars to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims.

Over this same time period, the Mali Empire in Africa grew to be the largest empire on the continent, stretching from Senegambia to Ivory Coast.

Meanwhile, Japan entered the Edo period, the Qing dynasty rose in China and the Mughal Empire ruled much of India. Europe underwent the Renaissance, starting in the 15th century, and the Age of Discovery began with the exploring and colonizing of new regions. This includes the British Empire expanding to become the world&apos;s largest empire and the colonization of the Americas. This expansion led to the Atlantic slave trade and the genocide of Native American peoples. This period also marked the Scientific Revolution, with great advances in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and physiology.

The United States of America underwent great change, going from a small group of colonies to one of the global superpowers. The Napoleonic Wars raged through Europe in the early 1800s, Spain lost most of its colonies in the New World, while Europeans continued expansion into Africa – where European control went from 10% to almost 90% in less than 50 years – and Oceania.

                Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to water and – depending on the lifestyle – other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and grazing livestock. Modern humans, however, have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, irrigation, urban planning, construction, deforestation and desertification. Human settlements continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and with low quality of construction. Grouping and deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of providing protection, accumulating comforts or material wealth, expanding the available food, improving aesthetics, increasing knowledge or enhancing the exchange of resources.

                Humans are one of the most adaptable species, despite having a low or narrow tolerance for many of the earth's extreme environments. Currently the species is present in all eight biogeographical realms, although their presence in the Antarctic realm is very limited to research stations and annually there is a population decline in the winter months of this realm. Humans established their nation-states in the other seven realms, such as for example South Africa, India, Russia, Australia, Fiji, United States and Brazil (each located in a different biogeographical realm).

                <br />
                By using advanced tools and clothing, humans have been able to extend their tolerance to a wide variety of temperatures, humidities, and altitudes. As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of the world, including tropical rainforest, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities; in comparison, most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability. The human population is not, however, uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface, because the population density varies from one region to another, and large stretches of surface are almost completely uninhabited, like Antarctica and vast swathes of the ocean. Most humans (61%) live in Asia; the remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).

                Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space. Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions. Humans have briefly visited the Moon and made their presence felt on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft. Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through research stations and, since 2000, in space through habitation on the International Space Station.

                Estimates of the population at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million. Around 50–60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. Bubonic plagues, first recorded in the 6th century AD, reduced the population by 50%, with the Black Death killing 75–200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa alone. Human population is believed to have reached one billion in 1800. It has since then increased exponentially, reaching two billion in 1930 and three billion in 1960, four in 1975, five in 1987 and six billion in 1999. It passed seven billion in 2011 and passed eight billion in November 2022. It took over two million years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 207 years more to grow to 7 billion. The combined biomass of the carbon of all the humans on Earth in 2018 was estimated at 60 million tons, about 10 times larger than that of all non-domesticated mammals.

                In 2018, 4.2 billion humans (55%) lived in urban areas, up from 751 million in 1950. The most urbanized regions are Northern America (82%), Latin America (81%), Europe (74%) and Oceania (68%), with Africa and Asia having nearly 90% of the world's 3.4 billion rural population. Problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime, especially in inner city and suburban slums. Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment. They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species. Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.
